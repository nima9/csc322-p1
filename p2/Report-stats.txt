Stats for an average file compared against a hard file.
General notes: mathsat ran noticeably slower when running the hard puzzle
Each area is formatted with the average file first and the hard file next.

# Variables:
#   We can see that the number of variables, literals and clauses is more for 
#   the hard puzzle this is because of the negative and positive operators
#   These operators cause a 2^n permutations of the variables for each - and / region.

# SAT:
#   We can see that the hard puzzle required 9 restarts vs to the average puzzle only required one restart.
#   We can also see that the number of random decisions, propagations, and watched clauses are much more for
#   the hard encoding.
#   This is because there are many more possible distribution of variable values for the variables in the hard
#   encoding, causing the SAT solver to make guesses and go down the wrong path while trying to solve the problem.

# EUF calls:
#   We can see that again the hard encoding requires many more euf calls and has more conflicts.
#   Therefore we can conclude that the encoding efficiency of the puzzle hard puzzle is worse causing 
#   more conflicts and euf implications.

# Memory and Runtime:
#   We can see that there is a non trivial difference in the runtime of the hard puzzle when compared
#   to the average puzzle. While we can see that the na-axiom_check_time and the na-sat_check_time
#   have a pretty trivial difference in run time. However, we can see that the overall run time and 
#   memory used by the sat solvers is not trivial. We can conclude this is do to the difference in the 
#   number of restarts required by the hard solver and the greater amount of propagations that the and
#   random guesses that hard encoding required.
