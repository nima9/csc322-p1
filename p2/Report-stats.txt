Stats for an average file compared against a hard file.
General notes: mathsat ran noticeably slower when running the hard puzzle
Each area is formatted with the average file first and the hard file next.
ie format
# observations on about the section
< average

> hard



# Variables:
#   We can see that the number of variables, literals and clauses is more for 
#   the hard puzzle this is because of the negative and positive operators
#   These operators cause a 2^n permutations of the variables for each - and / region.

# SAT:
#   We can see that the hard puzzle required 9 restarts vs to the average puzzle only required one restart.
